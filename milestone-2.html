                <h2 style="color:blue;">SUNDHAR PICHAI'S BIRTH</h2><h3>
Born on July 12, 1972 an Indian American boy from Madurai in Tamil Nadu was appointed as a new CEO of Google on 10th August 2015. It became a moment of pride for the Indian community to see an Indian-born make it to the list of the CEOs in the technological industry and Sundar Pichai’s life story is worth a share. SUNDAR PICHAI (or Sundarajan Pichai), a name now well-known across the globe has had his fair share of struggles before making it to the top.</h3>
<h2 style="color:blue;">SUNDAR PICHAI’S HUMBLE BEGINNINGS</h2><h3>
He was born to a middle class family in Madurai, Tamil Nadu and brought up in Ashok Nagar, Chennai. His mother, Lakshmi Pichai was a Stenographer and father Ragunatha Pichai was an Electrical engineer at General Electric Company, the Conglomerate. His father had a manufacturing plant that produced electrical components and that’s where Sundar Pichai got his interest in technology. His father introduced him to technology by sharing stories and challenges that he faced during his work day. His first encounter with technology and the first time Pichai was introduced to the technology was when he was 12 and his family bought their first telephone. He discovered how effortlessly he recalls the digits and he would remember every number he dialed. He did not know, of course, how useful this skill would be in the future. A boy from a small town in India, who would have thought Sundar Pichai’s net worth will be the talk of the nation someday (or talk of the world in this case)?
Sundar Pichai went to Jawahar Vidyalaya, a CBSE school in Ashok Nagar, Chennai and studied there till class 10th. He went to Vana Vani School in IIT, Madras for his high school.
